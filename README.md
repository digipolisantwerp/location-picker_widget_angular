# Location Picker Smart Widget UI (Angular)

This is the Angular 6+ UI for a Smart Widget implementing a picker field to choose a location (street, address or point of interest). It is matched by a [corresponding back-end service](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/location-picker_service_nodejs) which is needed when running it in remote mode. A default implementation for selecting locations in antwerp is provided.

There is a demo app, see below for instructions on running it.

## How to use

### Installing

```sh
> npm install @acpaas-ui-widgets/ngx-location-picker
```

### Using

A BFF service should be running (see demo app instructions below for how to start one).

Import the component in your module:

```ts
import { LocationPickerModule } from '@acpaas-ui-widgets/ngx-location-picker';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,
    LocationPickerModule
  ],
  ...
})
```

In the index.html, include the core branding stylesheet:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.antwerpen.be/core_branding_scss/4.1.1/main.min.css">
```

> For projects that are still using Angular 5, we are [maintaining a v1 branch](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/location-picker_widget_angular/tree/v1), which will still receive bug fixes if needed.

```sh
> npm install @acpaas-ui-widgets/ngx-location-picker@"<2.0.0"
```

### In your template:

```html
<aui-location-picker
    url="http://localhost:9999/api"
    [(value)]="location">
</aui-location-picker>
```

(replace the url of the BFF service)

In the component code:

```ts
class YourComponent {

    // you can assign an initial value here
    location: LocationPickerValue;

    ...
}
```

Every value in the backing list must have a unique id.

### Supported attributes

- **url**: the URL of the back-end service feeding this widget
- **bufferInputMs**: how long to buffer keystrokes before fetching remote results
- **value**: The current value of the picker, represented as a value object
- **placeholder**: specify the text to show in an empty field
- **noDataMessage**: the text shown in the list when there are no matching results

### Events

- **valueChange**: triggers when the current value is changed (or cleared)

### Protocol

The back-end service implements the following protocol:

- GET /path/to/endpoint?search=...&types=...
- search = the text that the user typed on which to match
- types = a comma-separated list of types to return, default value = "street,number,poi"
- result = JSON-encoded array of [LocationPickerValue](src/location-picker/location-picker.types.ts) objects

## Run the demo app

```sh
> npm install
> npm start
```

Browse to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

To use the location picker widget, you will need to have also started the corresponding back-end service.
